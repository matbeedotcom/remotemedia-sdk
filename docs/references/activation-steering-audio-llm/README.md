## Priority reading (start here)

If you only have time for four papers, read these in order:

1. **Panickssery et al. 2024 — Contrastive Activation Addition on Llama 2** ([arXiv:2312.06681](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681)). The technique your `LlamaCppSteerNode` already implements; concrete demonstration on the Llama family with thorough behavioral evaluation. *Cite as the technical foundation for Workstream A.*
2. **Nudging Hidden States 2026 — Cross-modal steering of audio-LLMs** ([arXiv:2603.14636](https://arxiv.org/html/2603.14636)). The closest published precedent for the cross-modal-steering architecture you're proposing. Shows text-derived steering vectors transfer to speech inputs in audio-LLMs. *Read carefully before claiming novelty.*
3. **Whisper SER with Attentive Pooling 2026** ([arXiv:2602.06000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06000)). Validates Whisper encoder + pooling head → emotion as the speech-side architecture for Workstream D1. Notes that intermediate layers often outperform final layers for SER — operationally relevant for `WhisperEmbeddingExtractorNode` design.
4. **Speech LLMs Survey 2024** ([arXiv:2410.18908](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.18908v6)). Field landscape; positions the proposed work relative to the input-layer-conditioning paradigm that dominates current Speech-LLM research.

## Workstream A — Activation Steering on a Frozen LLM

Foundational and follow-on work for `llama_apply_adapter_cvec`-style residual-stream interventions. These papers establish that linear directions in hidden-state space steer behavior with minimal capability degradation.

## Workstream D2/E (positioning) — Paralinguistic Speech LLMs

Adjacent prior art that conditions LLMs on prosody **at the input layer** (replacing text tokens with speech tokens, or training end-to-end). Useful for situating the proposed work, which intervenes at the **steering layer of a frozen LLM** instead.

## Notable absence

**No paper found that does exactly what is proposed:** project audio-derived prosodic embeddings through a low-dimensional VAD bottleneck into the steering subspace of a frozen LLM. Closest precedents are (a) text-derived steering of audio-LLMs ([2603.14636](https://arxiv.org/html/2603.14636)) and (b) input-layer prosody conditioning of speech-LLMs (USDM, PALLM, ParalinGPT). The specific architecture — **audio prosody → VAD → activation steering of frozen LLM** — appears unpublished as of this survey (April 2026). This is opportunity for novelty in any future writeup; it is also a signal to read the closest precedent ([2603.14636](https://arxiv.org/html/2603.14636)) carefully for any reason it might already be implicit in that work.

## Licensing note

arXiv papers are posted under non-exclusive licenses that permit viewing and downloading but **do not uniformly permit redistribution via third-party repositories**. PDFs are therefore gitignored from this repo. Each paper's license (some are CC-BY) appears in the right sidebar of its `arxiv.org/abs/<id>` page; if a future use case requires committed PDFs, audit per-paper licensing first.

The ScienceDirect article in the Whisper-SER section is not on arXiv and is publisher-restricted; `fetch.sh` does not attempt to download it.

## Maintenance

When adding a new paper:

1. Append a BibTeX entry to [`bibliography.bib`](bibliography.bib).
2. Add a row in the appropriate workstream section above with arXiv ID, short title, and one-sentence relevance note.
3. Add the arXiv ID to the array in [`fetch.sh`](fetch.sh).

When a recalled arXiv ID turns out wrong: fix it in `bibliography.bib`, this `README.md`, and `fetch.sh` together.
