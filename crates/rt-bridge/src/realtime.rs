//! `realtime` feature: apply thread priority and core affinity on the
//! bridge worker thread after spawn.
//!
//! This module is only compiled with `--features realtime`. It is a
//! best-effort helper — if the OS refuses to elevate priority or pin
//! the core (missing capability, restricted cgroup, etc.) we log and
//! continue rather than killing the process. That keeps the bridge
//! usable in unprivileged test environments; production deployments
//! should verify capabilities out-of-band.
