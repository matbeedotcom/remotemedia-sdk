//! Dynamic capability resolution (spec 022 extension, spec 023 pipeline resolution)
//!
//! This module extends the static capability system to support nodes with
//! runtime-dependent capabilities. Many nodes have capabilities that depend on:
//!
//! - **Configuration parameters** (e.g., MicInput's `sample_rate` param)
//! - **Connected upstream nodes** (e.g., SpeakerOutput matches its input)
//! - **Target requirements** (e.g., Resample outputs what downstream needs)
//! - **Runtime discovery** (e.g., actual device capabilities)
//!
//! # Capability Resolution Order (spec 023)
//!
//! 1. **Static** - Fixed at compile time (e.g., Whisper requires 16kHz mono)
//! 2. **Configured** - Resolved from node params after manifest parsing
//! 3. **Passthrough** - Output inherits from input (resolved during graph traversal)
//! 4. **Adaptive** - Output adapts to downstream requirements (reverse pass)
//! 5. **RuntimeDiscovered** - Two-phase: potential_capabilities() then actual_capabilities()
//!
//! # Two-Phase Resolution (spec 023)
//!
//! For RuntimeDiscovered nodes (e.g., hardware devices):
//! - **Phase 1**: Use `potential_capabilities()` for early validation (before device init)
//! - **Phase 2**: Call `actual_capabilities()` after `node.initialize()` completes
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // MicInput has configured output based on params
//! let mic_caps = resolve_capabilities(&mic_node, &mic_params, None)?;
//!
//! // Resample adapts output to match downstream Whisper requirements
//! let resample_caps = resolve_capabilities(
//!     &resample_node,
//!     &resample_params,
//!     Some(&whisper_input_caps),  // Target to adapt to
//! )?;
//! ```
