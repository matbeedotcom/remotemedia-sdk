# RemoteMedia Runtime Configuration Example
# Copy this file to runtime.toml and customize as needed

# Multiprocess Python Node Execution Configuration
# These settings control how Python nodes run in separate processes
# with shared memory IPC for zero-copy data transfer

# Maximum number of processes per session
# Set to a specific number to limit resource usage, or omit for unlimited
# Default: 10
max_processes_per_session = 10

# Channel buffer capacity (number of messages)
# Higher values allow more buffering but use more memory
# Default: 100
channel_capacity = 100

# Process initialization timeout in seconds
# How long to wait for a node to initialize before failing
# Increase for large models that take longer to load
# Default: 30
init_timeout_secs = 30

# Python executable path
# Can be "python", "python3", or an absolute path to a specific interpreter
# Use a virtualenv path to ensure correct dependencies are available
# Default: "python"
python_executable = "python"

# Enable backpressure on channels
# When true, blocks writes when channel is full (prevents data loss)
# When false, may drop data if consumer is slow
# Default: true
enable_backpressure = true
